Current things being worked on/ideas want to work on:

1. [X] Auto Servant Level
    - Other Servers are supported at Main Repository.

2. [X] Auto Skill Level

3. [X] Auto CE Bomb

4. [X] Auto Append Upgrade

5. [X] Auto Lottery-Gift Box loop

6. [X] Auto Friend Point Summon to CE Bomb

7. [X] Auto Screenshot of bond level up

8. [ ] Auto send friend request
    1. [ ] Need to have full friend list to get the error when sending request with full list.

9. [ ] Option to return to menu once quest is done.

10. [ ] Tea pots but per battle config

11. [ ] Recognized Crit stars

12. [ ] Update the logic of parsing commands in `Skill Maker`.

    Would make the commands be able to know their wave and/or turn order.

13. [ ] Integration with Laplace from [Chaldea](https://github.com/chaldea-center/chaldea).

    The Idea is to able to get data from Laplace and then copy paste it into another text box.

    Then it would parse itself to FGA Battle Config format.
    1. [ ] Work on Servant Profiles.
    2. [ ] Better Command Summary.
    3. [ ] Spam 2.0
